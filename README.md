● Create Database - Orange HRM

● I have created the Employee and Dependent table in the OrangeHRM database.
● I have created a link between the 2 tables using primary and foreign keys.
● I created insert, update, delete, drop, alter and truncate instructions.
● I specified in a multiline comment above each group of instructions
what each is and what is it's role.
● I have created a set of selection statements that includes both the selection of all
columns as well as selecting a set of columns.
● I also created statements with simple filtering (a single condition of
filtering) as well as with compound filtering (more than one filtering condition) both with
the OR operator as well as the AND operator.
● I wrote filtering instructions based on the LIKE operator.
● Each table has at least 10 records. I have experimented with both
simple insert statements (one line per insert) as well as with statements of
compound insert (inserting multiple rows at the same time)
●I've also experimented with both simple upgrade instructions
(updating a single column per statement), as well as with statements of
compound update (updating multiple columns in the same statement)
● I added statements containing aggregate functions and the GROUP BY clause.
